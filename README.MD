# JS Practice Problems

## Organization

Add problems to the current folders and levels as needed.Add

## Testing your files

1. Open `package.json`
2. Modify `test` script to reflect current problem file path.

   1. NB: DO NOT wrap file path in quotes; see examples

   ```js
   // File: ./codewars/8kyu/sumOfDiffArray.js

   {
     "script":{
      "test" : "node ./codewars/8kyu/sumOfDiffArray.js"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Test your newly changed command to see if output is correct with a `console.log` or something.
